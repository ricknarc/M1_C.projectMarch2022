# C project Implementation
* In Implementation, use of linked lists and Queues has been done.
# Linked list
* Linked List is a sequential collection of nodes, Which is faster than array in terms of deletion of nodes. 
* Itâ€™s memory is dynamically allocated in runtime. This saves time and space.
# Queue
* Queue is a data structure in which insertion and deletion takes place from the ends, It follows First In First Out Principle.
* Use of Queue has been done to store the waiting list passengers. If anyone cancels their  ticket then that seat will be allocated to the first passenger in the queue.
